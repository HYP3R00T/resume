= Experience
#experience(
  "Wipro Ltd.",
  "May 2022 - Feb 2024",
  [Project Engineer],
  [Remote, India],
)[
  - Developed an automated testing framework for AWS-based data pipelines using Python and Boto3, reducing regression time by ~87% (from 2 hours to 15 minutes) across services like S3, Lambda, and Aurora.
  - Created a cross-platform Data Validator leveraging DuckDB and SQL, enabling seamless functional testing across PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server with minimal manual intervention.
  - Containerized testing workflows using Docker, deployed on OpenShift, and enabled shift-left testing across DEV and SYS environments.
  - Integrated with Jenkins CI/CD pipelines for automated test execution, reducing feedback cycles by 40% and ensuring continuous validation.
  - Delivered reusable automation frameworks (e.g., RDS ODS Automation Suite, Heterogeneous Query Builder) adopted by multiple internal teams to standardize data validation practices.
  - Enabled earlier detection of data quality issues during the development and system testing phases, improving release confidence and reducing manual QA overhead by 70%.
